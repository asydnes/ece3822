CLINICAL
CORRELATION
This
patient
s
clinical
symptoms
did
not
appear
to
be
associated
with
well
defined
epileptiform
abnormalities
On
one
day
however
there
were
discharges
which
appear
epileptiform
in
nature
While
this
patient
did
not
have
any
of
her
larger
spells
with
head
turning
a
feeling
as
if
her
throat
was
closing
or
impairment
of
awareness
this
record
does
not
exclude
a
diagnosis
and
clinically
diagnosis
may
be
considered
